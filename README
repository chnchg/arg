arg-1.0

For simple applications, you just need to copy `arg.cc' and `arg.hh' to your
program directory, then, compile your program with something like:

	$ c++ my_prog.cc arg.cc -I. -o my_exec

You can also install `libarg' to your system with the usual:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

Then, you can compile your program with something like:

	$ c++ my_prog.cc -I/usr/local/include/arg-1.0 -larg -o my_exec

For more details, please see the file `INSTALL'.

Homepage URL of arg is http://ccdw.org/~cjj/prog/arg/ where you can
also find all the documentation.
